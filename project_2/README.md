## 📚 what i learned 

- Learned the basic of C/C++ programmation (variable, instructions, functions)
- Learned how to manage LEDs light using the arduino IDE
- First use of digital pins
- Discovered how small wiring mistakes can affect the behavior of LEDs.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of basic circuit theory and component connections before moving to more complex Arduino projects.
